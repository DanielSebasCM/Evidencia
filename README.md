**TicTackToe**

Using turtle and freegames a simple version of tick tack toe was implemented. Each player takes turns clicking on a square to place their icon on a square of the grid and the first player to complete three in a row wins. In this implementation there is no detection of winning or loosing states but the size of the player icons can be customized through a variable. The program will also prohibit players from placing a move in a square thats already occupied.
